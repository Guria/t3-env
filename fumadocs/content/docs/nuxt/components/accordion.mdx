## Linking to Accordion

You can specify an `id` for accordion. The accordion will automatically open when the user is navigating to the page with the specified `id` in hash parameter.

```mdx
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="My Title" id="my-title">

My Content

</Accordion>
</Accordions>
```

> The value of accordion is `title` by default. When an `id` is specified, it will be used as the value instead.
