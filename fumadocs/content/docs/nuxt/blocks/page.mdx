title: Page
description: A page in your documentation
---

Page is the base element of a documentation, it includes Table of contents,
Footer, and Breadcrumb.

## Usage

```mdx
import { DocsPage, DocsBody } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';

<DocsPage>
  <DocsBody>...</DocsBody>
</DocsPage>
```

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/ui/props.ts",
  "name": "PageProps"
}
```

### Body

To apply the [Typography](/docs/ui/theme#typography) styles, wrap your content in the `DocsBody` component.

```mdx
import { DocsBody } from 'fumadocs-ui/page';

<DocsBody>
  <h1>This heading looks good!</h1>
</DocsBody>
```

### Table of Contents

It is an array with all the headings in your document. For Markdown or MDX
documents, You can parse TOC by using the
[TOC Utility](/docs/headless/utils/get-toc). Some source providers may offer this out-of-the-box.

In addition, you can easily customise or disable TOC in your documentation.

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/ui/props.ts",
  "name": "TOCProps"
}
```

### Last Update Time

Since you might have different version controls (e.g. Github) or it's from
remote sources like Sanity, Fumadocs UI doesn't display last updated time by
default.

For Github hosted documents, you can use
the [Git Last Modified](/docs/headless/utils/git-last-edit) utility.

```tsx
<DocsPage lastUpdate={new Date(lastModifiedTime)} />
```

### Footer

Footer is a navigation element that has two buttons to jump to the next and previous pages. By default, it finds the neighbour pages from page tree.

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/ui/props.ts",
  "name": "FooterProps"
}
```

### Breadcrumb

```json doc-gen:typescript
{
  "file": "./content/docs/ui/props.ts",
  "name": "BreadcrumbProps"
}
```
