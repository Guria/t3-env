description: Build page tree with file-system based routing

## Overview

This is a shared convention for organizing your pages, should be followed by all built-in file-system based sources including Contentlayer and Fumadocs MDX.

## File

By default, it uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and supports `title` and
`description` frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: My Page
description: Best document ever
---

```

You may edit the configuration file to add additional properties.

## Folder

You can use folders to organize multiple pages, the uppercased name of the
folder will be used as the display name.

By default, pages are sorted with `String.localeCompare{:js}`.
The `index.mdx` file is always ordered at the top.

### Meta

You can also customize the folder name, order of pages, or add a separator by
creating a `meta.json` in the folder.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "---Separator---", "components"] // file name of pages
}
```

### Open by Default

Force to open the folder by default.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "defaultOpen": true
}
```

### Multiple Page Trees

Adding a `root` property in meta can mark your folder as a root folder.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "root": true
}
```

The nearest root folder of current page will be used as the root of page tree.

### Separator

You can define a separator in meta by adding a item surrounded by
`---`.

```json
{
  "title": "Name of Folder",
  "pages": ["---Separator---"]
}
```

### Rest

Tired to specify the order of every single page in `meta.json`? You can use
`...` to automatically add and sort remaining items.

<Callout title="Note" className="mb-4">
  Index pages won't be included, you must specify the order of `index`.
</Callout>

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "..."]
}
```

### Extract

You can extract the items from a folder with `...folder_name`.

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["guide", "...folder"]
}
```

### External Link

Use the syntax `[Text](url)` to insert external links.

```json
{
  "title": "Folder",
  "pages": ["index", "[Vercel](https://vercel.com)"]
}
```

## Icons

It is supported to have custom icons for a page or a folder with the `icon`
property.

```mdx
---
title: My Page
icon: MyIcon
---
```

```json
{
  "title": "My Folder",
  "icon": "MyIcon"
}
```

> See [Source API](/docs/headless/source-api#icons) to learn how to handle icons.

## Internationalization

You can create a page for specific language by adding `.{locale}` to your MDX
file name. Pages can't be language-specific, you must create a page for default
locale in order to have its localized version.

It is same for meta files, you have to add `.{locale}` to the file name like `meta.cn.json`.

> If it's the default language, just leave it empty like `get-started.mdx`. Do
> not use add locale code to file name.

Assume your default language is `en`.
